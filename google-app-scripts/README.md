This folder contains Google App Scripts created to extend the capabilities of Google forms/spreadsheets to fit the needs of CAVP.

##`ViewResponses` 
Allows a user to see a modal with the responses from a form entry instead of having to horizontally scroll across the row.

To use, from a Google Sheet, go to `Tools > Script editor....`, create a new app script and copy the code from `ViewResponses.gs` into it. After running it initially, you should have an added menu option under `Add-ons`.
